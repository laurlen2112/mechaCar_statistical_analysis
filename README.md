# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview:
This analysis uses R on datasets generated by the MechaCar prototype team to glean insights that may assist the production team in overcoming issues blocking production.  The underlying code for this analysis was created in R notebook.  In addition to describing the results of the analysis, this report will describe a statistical study design that MechaCar can use as a basis for proof that their cars are superior to the competition.

## Results:
**Deliverable 1**
* As indicated by the 3 stars next to their Pr(>|t|) values, both vehicle length and ground clearance have statistically significant values.  The 3 star significance code means that the value ranges is between 0 and 0.001.  Additionally, vehicle weight has some statical significance which is indicated by the dot[.] next to its value.  The dot indicates that the value ranges between 0.05 to 0.1.  However, vehicle weight is less significant that vehicle length and ground clearance since vehicle weight has a larger p-value than the other metrics.

* When the slope of a model is zero that means there is a lack of significant linear relationship between the variables. The slope of dataset cannot be considered to be zero because the p-value is 5.35<sup> -11</sup>, which is smaller than an assumed significance level of 0.05.

* The R-squared value is also known as the coefficient of determination and usually ranges between 0 and 1.  This metric determines the likelihood that future data will fit with this linear model.  Here, the R-squared is 0.7149, which is interpreted to mean that about 71% of the variability is explained by this model.

**Deliverable 2**

Deliverable 2 tests the weight capacities of suspension coils.  The variance metric from the total_summary data frame and the variance metrics of Lot 1 and Lot 2 from the lot_summary data frame indicate that the suspension coils are within MechaCar's specifications of 100 pounds per square inch.  However, the variance metric of Lot 3 is about 170.29, which exceeds MechaCar's guidance.

**Deliverable 4**
Given the current climate of rising gas prices, fuel efficiency is likely foremost on consumers' minds.  Therefore, if MechaCar can demonstrate superior fuel efficiency compared to the competition it will provide a compelling message to consumers.

* **Metrics to Test**: Various metrics likely contribute to fuel efficiency, such as vehicle weight and vehicle design elements that might reduce drag.  Metrics would need to be gathered from MechaCar and the competition so that MechaCar's products can be tested against the competition.

* **Suggested Hypotheses**:
	* Null hypothesis: There is no connection between vehicle weight or vehicle design and fuel efficiency.
	* Alternative hypothesis: Vehicle weight and/or vehicle design elements contribute to fuel efficiency.  Due to vehicle weight and vehicle design of MechaCar's cars, their products are x% more efficient than the competition. 
	
* **Suggested Statistical Tests**: As discussed above, in Deliverable 1, a linear regression analysis can be used predict MPG based on vehicle design aspects.  It is suggested that each car model undergo a linear regression and results can be compared to determine which car models are the most fuel efficient.  Additionally, MechaCar may use this analysis in the design of future cars.  It could design a highly fuel efficient vehicle by choosing the most fuel efficient design components and creating a new car model with those components. 

* **Data Needed for this Analysis**: MechaCar would need to collect data.  For example, to collect data for vehicle weight it could 
categorize each model by weight and look at how many miles per gallon each vehicle gets.
